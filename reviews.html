								There are a lot of beautiful books about space and astronomy out there, but this one really is a cut above. The infographics themselves are eye-popping, and the captions pack a punch of their own, deftly guiding readers through elegantly presented information about space exploration, telescopes, cosmology and more.

								Simple-looking line drawings encode a vast amount of information about everything from telescopes to the 30,000 nearest galaxies. Each graphic occupies all the available area on every two-page spread. Although the graphics are organized by topic, I was often surprised as I turned from one page to the next. One page shows relative sizes of planets and moons; the next, an enormous chart summarizing future lunar and solar eclipses throgh 2050; the next, an amusing comparison of the solar system's top ten tallest mountains, biggest lakes, longest channels, and largest craters; the next, scale comparisons of the interior structures of the 14 largest worlds orbiting the Sun. (I had no idea that Loki Patera's lake of lava is the same size as Lakes Baikal and Tanganyika. Yikes.) It's the kind of book that you can pick up and turn to any page and enjoy what you find, but you have to read it cover to cover to be delighted by each and every page.

								Infographics remain on a roll, offering visual insight into abstruse regions of human knowledge. Astronomers Stuart Lowe and Chris North really lift off in this graphic exploration of all things space. Their depictions of year-by-year spaceflights and space junk shock through sheer numbers, while their takes on interplanetary missions, moons in the Solar System and particularly the polarization of the Milky Way &mdash; like a cosmic finger-painting in palest mauve &mdash; deliver the facts with aesthetic brio

								Cosmos: The Infographic Book of Space by Stuart Lowe and Chris North is a guilty pleasure of space-related facts presented with minimalistic graphic images and charts that bring out interesting facts details. Topics include space exploration, the solar system, stars, galaxies, and other worlds.

								&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; Just when I was feeling like space books were getting a little "stale" Cosmos showed up at my door step. I assure you this book is anything but stale. The general premise is a compilation of beautifully crafted "infographics" (read: fun ways to interpret and graphically display data) about a wide variety of space topics. Initially I thought that the book may open to a Buzzfeed-type conglomeration of graphics made by a variety of different sources, but no!! Lowe and North have gathered, organized and presented space data in a cohesively cosmic collection!

								&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; At my child's request, we read two pages of this book every night. It has held my space-obsessed 5 year old's attention since he received it at Christmas. He loves to pour over the details.. highest, longest, farthest, etc. Great book!

								Cosmos The Infographic Book of Space by Stuart Lowe & Chris North is quite frankly, a must have for anyone with the slightest glimmer of interest in Milky Way and beyond... the kind of book you can read from cover to cover in no time at all, but you can also use it as a reference to check thoughts or ideas you might have.  It has a stunning layout, with bright, vibrant illustrations that grab you as soon as you turn the page and the infographic nature of the book helps to encourage the retention of the incredible information contained in its pages.  It id definitely suited to all ages and levels of interest in the final frontier, from small children who are eager to learn, right up to seasoned veterans of the genre.

								Cosmos is made up of cleverly done, interesting, and information-rich graphics... I found Cosmos hard to put down and enjoyed examining the 105+ graphic illustrations... Cosmos was designed to satisfy an adult mind but is child-friendly for kids who are not afraid to squint their eyes and think.

								&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; Excellent quick read on the entire universe as we now know it. Just the right amount of written material to accompany the thorough graphic presentations, and you don't have to be a scientist to understand the subject matter. Recommended to all for learning more about space - you can read this in a few hours and feel much more knowledgeable looking up into the night sky!

								&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; All of the visuals have a feeling of 1960s space-age artwork to them, making simply looking at the book an experience in itself without digesting the data... Overall, the authors have given us a new way of exploring the cosmos even on cloudy Vermont nights.
